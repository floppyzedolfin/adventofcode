# Advent of Code

This is my take on the [2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) using the GO language.


## Quickstart

1. Checkout the project, then download dependencies:
    ```
    make init
    ```
   
1. Run, giving the number of the day as parameter:
    ```
    make DOOR=1 run
    ```
    or
    ```
    make build
    ./adventofcode.out -day 1
    ```
   
You can also run unit tests:
```
make test
```
